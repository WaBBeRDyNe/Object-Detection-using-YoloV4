# Object-Detection using YOLOv4

## Description
Object-Detection-using-YOLOv4 is a powerful project that utilizes a pre-trained YOLOv3 model to detect objects in real-time. Unlike traditional object detection systems, this project goes a step further by incorporating Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality. Not only does it display the detected objects and their positions in the console, but it also provides an audio output, making it more inclusive and accessible for users with visual impairments.

## YOLOv3 Model and Weights
The core of this project is built upon the YOLOv3 object detection model, which is renowned for its efficiency and accuracy. The weights file necessary for running the model can be conveniently downloaded from the official YOLO website. Simply visit https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights to obtain the weights file.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/WaBBeRDyNe/Object-Detection-using-YoloV4.git
   ```
2. Run the Application: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, navigate to the project's base folder and Execute the "real-time-audio.py" file using any Python-enabled code editor or directly in the PowerShell terminal using the following command:
   ```
   python real-time-audio.py
   ```
   **Note:** If you're not running the script from the base folder, make sure to provide the complete path to the "real-time-audio.py" file.
